## How to Use  
Navigate to https://infinite-savannah-02998.herokuapp.com/. You will see two lists. On the left, a list of "Burgers I Want to Eat". On the right, a list of "Burgers I've Already Eaten". Underneath these lists there is a field where you can add a burger to the "Burgers I Want to Eat" list by typing in the name of the burger and clicking "Add Burger".  

When you've eaten a burger, or if you just want to see a burger move from the left to the right, click that burger's "Devour It!" button and watch the magic happen!

## How I Made This  
Using MVC principles, the functionality for this app was spread out into multiple small files. Building this from scratch allowed me to understand how the front and back end connect internally and to each other, how to use models, how to use a homemade ORM, and how to use handlebars. This was also the first time I deployed to Heroku with a database.
